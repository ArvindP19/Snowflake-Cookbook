**Techniques for building modern cloud data warehousing solutions**

## What is this book about?
Snowflake is a unique cloud-based data warehousing platform built from scratch to perform data management on the cloud. This book introduces you to Snowflake's unique architecture, which places it at the forefront of cloud data warehouses.
You'll explore the compute model available with Snowflake, and find out how Snowflake allows extensive scaling through the virtual warehouses. You will then learn how to configure a virtual warehouse for optimizing cost and performance. Moving on, you'll get to grips with the data ecosystem and discover how Snowflake integrates with other technologies for staging and loading data.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Get to grips with data warehousing techniques aligned with Snowflake's cloud architecture
* Broaden your skills as a data warehouse designer to cover the Snowflake ecosystem
* Transfer skills from on-premise data warehousing to the Snowflake cloud analytics platform
* Optimize performance and costs associated with a Snowflake solution
* Stage data on object stores and load it into Snowflake
